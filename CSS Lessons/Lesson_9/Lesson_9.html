        <h1>Cascade of CSS Example</h1>
        <h2>Subheading 1</h2>
        <p> Inheritance allows us to write more global styles on parent elements
            and then "fine-tune" the styles for some of the child elements as needed.
            Such approach makes writing CSS very efficient.</p>

            <p>Another concept which is semantically similar to bioavailability is
                bioaccessibility. For a contaminant to be bioaccessible, it must first
                be dissolved in the gut fluid. A fraction of the dissolved concentration
                then passes through the intestinal membrane to become bioavailable.</p>
