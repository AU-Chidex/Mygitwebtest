       Bioavailability is the fraction of organic contaminants that 
        crosses from the environment inhabitated by an organism 
        into an internal site of toxic action. Another concept which is semantically similar to bioavailability is
        bioaccessibility. For a contaminant to be bioaccessible, it must first
        be dissolved in the gut fluid. A fraction of the dissolved concentration
        then passes through the intestinal membrane to become bioavailableAnother concept which is semantically similar to bioavailability is
